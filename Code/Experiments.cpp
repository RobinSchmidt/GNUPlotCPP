Ideas:
-move high-level vector-field to demos - make a demo showing a positive charge at +1 and a negative
 charge at -1 using the physically correct law for the electric field - make another plot with two
 negative and two positive charges - the two negative charges should look like 2 gravitational 
 fields - call it demoDipole



-plot 3D curves (trefoil knot)
-plot 3D vector fields
-plot curves on top of a 2D vector field - can be used to show equipotential curves and/or 
 integration paths

Field lines:
-draw field lines of 2D vector fields - how do we find them? start somewhere and follow the field?
 ...but what about error accumulation? ...in any case, it seems we need a general way to add many
 curves to a vector field (for field lines of vector fields and equipotential lines for scalar
 fields)
 https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-find-an-expression-for-vector-field-lines
 https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1992208/how-to-find-the-field-lines-of-a-vector-field
-maybe we should plot the field lines as parametric curves whose equations should be obtained
 analytically? maybe like this:
 -let f(x,y) and g(x,y) be the functions that define our vector field
 -we want a family of parametric curves x(t), y(t) such that in any point x,y on one of the curves, 
  the curve's tangent is in the direction of the vector field - so we require: 
  x'(t) = f(x(t),y(t)), y'(t) = g(x(t),y(t)) for any t, or shorter: x' = f(x,y), y' = g(x,y)
  -> this is a system of 2 first order differential equations
  -> maybe if f and g are simple enough, we can find an analytic solution to this system?
  -> if, not - use a numerical initial value solver:
     -choose a couple of strategically placed points in the plane (for example, equidistant on
      one of the axes) and just follow the field for positive and negative times
     -if start and end-points are known (such as with a dipole), maybe a boundary value solver
      can be used? 
      -for the dipole, we know that lines start at the source and end at the sink
      -we may also have to select an initial direction
     -maybe the function object passed to the plotter that generates the field lines is the solver?
      or maybe i should pre-solve the equation and pass some sort of InterpolatingFunction object
      (makes more sense, since the plotting routines want random access functions)
-for the complex mapping w = f(z) = z^2 interpreted as vector field, this leads to the first order
 ODE system x' = x^2 - y^2, y' = 2*x*y where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the 
 parameter t.
 wolfram alpha can solve this with the command:
 DSolve[ {x'[t] == x[t]^2 - y[t]^2, y'[t] == 2 x[t] y[t]}, {x, y}, t]
 which reults in 2 solutions:

  x = -(e^(2 C1) (t - 2 C2))/(1 + e^(2 C1) t^2 - 4 e^(2 C1) t C2 + 4 e^(2 C1) (C2)^2)
  y = 1/2 (e^(C1) + sqrt(e^(2 C1) - (4 e^(4 C1) (t - 2 C2)^2)/(1 + e^(2 C1) t^2 - 4 e^(2 C1) t C2 + 4 e^(2 C1) (C2)^2)^2))

  x = -(e^(2 C1) (t + 2 C2))/(1 + e^(2 C1) t^2 + 4 e^(2 C1) t C2 + 4 e^(2 C1) (C2)^2)
  y = 1/2 (e^(C1) - sqrt(e^(2 C1) - (4 e^(4 C1) (t + 2 C2)^2)/(1 + e^(2 C1) t^2 + 4 e^(2 C1) t C2 + 4 e^(2 C1) (C2)^2)^2))

  ...try plotting them for various values of C1, C2 ...maybe to simplify, define 
  k1 = e^C1, k2 = e^C2, k12 = k1^2 = e^(2 C1), etc.

  do the same for x' = x^2 - y^2, y' = -2*x*y - the additional minus sign accounts for complex 
  conjugation of the Polya vector field associated to f(z) = z^2:
  DSolve[ {x'[t] == x[t]^2 - y[t]^2, y'[t] == -2 x[t] y[t]}, {x, y}, t]
  ...but wolfram alpha doesn't understand this - wtf - the only difference is a minus sign!

  can we find a scalar valued function of x,y whose gradient is our desired vector field, i.e. a 
  potential function for our vector field?






  -> integrate with respect to t


  so it seems we
  must partially integrate f and g to obtain: 
  x(t) = integral_a^t f(x,y) dx, y(t) = integral_b^t g(x,y) dy
  for some constants a,b for the lower limits...is that correct? it seems reasonable to have two
  free parameters a,b since for each point on the plane, there should be exactly one field line
  that passes through it - so if we pick apoint x,y in the plane, we should be able to adjust a,b
  to find a field line through it (however that same field line passes through many points..hmm)




-how would we represent a scalar field in 3D? maybe as (semi-transparent) spheres with a size 
 representing the value? or maybe the transparency should represent the value? or both? ..or maybe
 cubes instead of spheres?
